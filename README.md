## Advanced User-Level Thread Library

## Overview
Created the "Advanced User-Level Thread Library". This project employs advanced multithreading techniques in C++ to create a user-level threading library. The implementation features thread creation, context switching, scheduling algorithms, and synchronization mechanisms like mutexes and semaphores to manage concurrent execution efficiently. The project demonstrates a deep understanding of low-level system programming, memory management, and concurrent computing.

## Features
Thread Creation: Supports creating multiple threads within a process.
Context Switching: Efficiently switches between threads to simulate parallel execution.
Scheduling Algorithms: Implements various scheduling strategies to manage thread execution.
Synchronization Mechanisms: Includes mutexes and semaphores to ensure proper synchronization between threads.
Low-Level System Programming: Demonstrates advanced techniques in system-level programming and memory management.

## How It Works
#Thread Creation:
The library provides a function to create new threads. When a new thread is created, it is added to a thread table and assigned a unique thread ID.

#Context Switching:
The library uses context switching to switch between threads. This involves saving the state of the currently running thread and loading the state of the next thread to be executed. Context switching is implemented using low-level assembly instructions and setjmp/longjmp functions.

#Scheduling Algorithms:
The library includes various scheduling algorithms to manage thread execution. These algorithms determine the order in which threads are executed and how CPU time is allocated to each thread. Common algorithms include round-robin and priority scheduling.

#Synchronization Mechanisms:
To ensure proper synchronization between threads, the library includes mutexes and semaphores. Mutexes are used to protect critical sections of code, while semaphores are used to manage access to shared resources.

#Low-Level System Programming:
The implementation of the library involves advanced low-level system programming techniques. This includes managing the stack for each thread, handling interrupts, and managing memory allocation for thread control blocks.
